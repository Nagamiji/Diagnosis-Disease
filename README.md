## Diagnosis Diseasea using ML and DL

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for diagnosing diseases and providing personalized recommendations. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we seek to enhance medical diagnosis accuracy and assist healthcare professionals in decision-making. 

### Key Objectives  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data for optimal model performance.  
- **Model Selection**: Implementing and comparing multiple classification models, including:  
  - Random Forest (RF)  
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Neural Networks  
- **Optimization Techniques**: Utilizing methods such as:  
  - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning  
  - K-fold cross-validation for model validation  
  - MultiOutputClassifier for handling multi-target classification tasks  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using classification reports, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Enhancement Strategies**: Implementing ensemble learning and feature selection to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.  

### Expected Outcomes  
By following this structured approach, we aim to develop a robust, scalable, and interpretable machine learning system capable of assisting medical professionals in disease diagnosis and recommendation generation. This system will help in making accurate, data-driven decisions, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
